TileDB Documentation
====================

TileDB is an efficient multi-dimensional array management system which introduces a novel on-disk format that can effectively store dense and sparse array data with support for fast updates. It offers numerous features, including excellent compression, high IO performance on multiple data persistence backends (e.g., HDFS and S3), and easy integration with ecosystems used by todayâ€™s data scientists (e.g., Python NumPy).

TileDB is open-sourced under the permissive MIT License.

Here you will find a comprehensive description of all the TileDB features, installation guides, tutorials, and API references. Enjoy!
