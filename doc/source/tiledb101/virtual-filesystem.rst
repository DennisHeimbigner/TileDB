Virtual Filesystem
==================

TileDB is architected such that all IO to/from the storage backends is
abstracted behind a **Virtual Filesystem** module. This module supports
simple operations, such as creating a file/directory, reading/writing to
a file, etc. This abstraction enables us to easily plug in more storage
backends in the future, effectively making the storage backend opaque to
the user.

A nice positive "side-effect" of this architecture is that it possible
to expose the basic virtual filesystem functionality via the TileDB C
API ::ref::`Figure 23 <figure-23>`). This provides a simplified interface for file IO and
directory management (i.e., not related to arrays) on all storage
backends TileDB supports.

.. note:: 
    Currently the virtual filesystem functionality **does not support seekable writes**, 
    but rather only appends, due to the fact that this is the only write mode in
    TileDB and because of our integration with append-only filesystems like
    HDFS and S3. Moreover, **moving files across filesystems** is not yet
    implemented. We plan to add both seakable writes (for filesystems that
    support it) and moving across filesystems in the next release."
